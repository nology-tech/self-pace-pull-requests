    <ul>
        <li>What is branching?</li>
        <p> Branching allows developers to develop new features in isolation from the main branch
            without altering the stable working code of the main branch.</p>
        <li>What is merging?</li>
        <p>Once the code of the feature branch has been tested and reviwed, it can be merged back
            in with the main branch, and the main branch will contain all the commit history of the feature branch</p>
        <li>What is a pull request?</li>
        <p>Allows the owners/maintainers of the main branch to review code merges before the feature
            branches can be merged with the main branch. This allows visibility and transparency
            around the changes for the whole team to see what has been added or changed</p>
