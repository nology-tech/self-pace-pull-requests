    <h1>Branching</h1>
    <p>Branching allows us to develop features in isolation (away from the main branch), that we can later merge into our main(production) branch</p>
    <p>To create a new branch - you can do it in 2 steps:
       <ul>
            <li>git branch nameOfNewBranch</li>
            <li>git checkout nameOfNewBranch</li>
            <li>OR in 1 command type: git checkout -b nameOfNewBranch</li>
       </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Merging</h1>
    <p>To merge new changes that someone else has added to the remote repository I can PULL them down</p>
    <p>The PULL is going to bring the repository from the REMOTE (github) to our Local Repository AND merge it into our WORKING DIRECTORY where our local repo now matches the remote repo</p>
    <p>good to note this can be done in two individual steps (FETCH and MERGE) however we will be using PULL going forwards </p>


    <h1>Pull Requests</h1>
    <p>A pull request allows other developers in your team to review the code you've written on new features, branches etc before being MERGED into the main (production) branch </p>
    <p>It encourages an open discussion around changes to the code base with the other developers. It allows visibility and transparency around the updates/changes, before they are approved and the branches are merged</p>


  <h1>Question</h1>
  <p>If you are working in your local working directory on a shared team project, how do you know when changes have been made (that are different to your version of the codebase)Is there a way you are notified? </p>
