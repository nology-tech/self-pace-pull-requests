    <h1>Pull Request Challenge</h1>
    <h3>Just what is Github?</h3>
    <p>
      As far as I understand it is a web-based version-control platform that
      allows software developers to collaborate easily and efficiently to
      projects. Using push and pull requests, developers can create various
      branches on the same project, committing along the way, allowing work to
      consistently be backed up. It essentially creates a fool-proof way of
      adding to the same project, with access to previous versions so as to
      never lose anything and at the same time keeping track of progress.
