  <h3>My thoughts on GitHub</h3>
  <p>GitHub is the website where developers can store and manage the code. With git commits you can track all changes done on the code. You don't need to be afraid of loosing the code or making adjustment to the code after storing on GitHub. Other developers as well can access the code and contribute to it. Its very helpful working in a team on same project. Accessibility to the code makes everyone's life easy if you do it everything right.
    With Git I always have some issues after git push. Always some new issues coming:(.
