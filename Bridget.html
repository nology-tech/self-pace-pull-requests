    <h1>Thoughts, understanding and questions around GitHub</h1>  
    <br>
    <h2>What is GitHub?</h1>
    <p>
      GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store
      and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
      Github is a managed service which is used to host git version control. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is version control?</h1>
    <p>
      Git is an example of a distributed version control system. Version control 
      systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage 
      changes to source code over time. If a mistake is made, developers can turn 
      back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake 
      while minimizing disruption to all team members. In addition to more robust code 
      management (backup / reversion control). Version control systems make 
      it easier to share code between multiple developers (collaboration and code 
      reviews).
         
    </p>
      <h2>Branching and merging</h2>
<p>
      As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. If a developer wants to
      work on one specific part of a codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them 
      directly edit the “official” source code. Instead, version control lets developers safely 
      work through branching and merging. With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source 
      code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the 
      code without affecting the rest of the project. Then, once the developer gets his or her part 
      of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to 
      make it official. All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.
    </p>
    
      <h2>What is a pull request?</h2>

      <p>
        Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on 
        GitHub Enterprise Server. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the 
        potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged 
        into the base branch.
