    <h2>What is branching?</h2>
    <p>Git allows us to create different branches in a project. This way, we can work on a task independently without worrying about other changes made by the team. It also allows us to create code reviews by creating a pull request.</p>

    <h2>What is merging?</h2>
    <p>Merging is to push the code from one source branch to a target one. This is the step where we can identify possible conflicts.</p>
    
    <h2>What is a pull request?</h2>
    <p>It is a functionality that version control platforms like gitHub offer. This enables the team to easily see the new code changes when merging one branch to another, making it easier to review the code and identify possible problems.</p>
