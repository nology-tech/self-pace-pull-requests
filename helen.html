    <h3>What is branching?</h3>

    <p>We can make a copy of a repository to add a new feature, make changes and then push this up to the main version. This means we can turn back time if mistakes are made on the copy</p>

    <h3>What is merging?</h3>

    <p>When we merge the branch with the main version</p>

    <h3>What is a pull request?</h3>

    <p>This lets others know about changes that have been made. These changes can then be reviewed before they are merged with the main copy</p>
