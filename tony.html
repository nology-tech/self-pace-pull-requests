    <p>
      Github is a cloud based resporitory for storing files/code. It's remote so
      everyone can have access to it and collaborate. Able to clone/copy a repo
      to one's own computer to work on.

    <ul>
      <li>What is branching?</li>
      <p>
        Branching allows a developer to create a copy for working on that is
        independent of the main branch and thus doesn't affect it.
      </p>
      <li>What is merging?</li>
      <p>
        It is the process of merging one branch into another. For instance, when
        working on a branch we have updated the colour of a button, when we are
        satisified that it's correct and want to apply/incorporate the change
        into the main branch(live code) we do this via merging.
      </p>
      <li>What is a pull request?</li>
      <p>
        A pull request is a when a developer has, for example, completed a code
        task and wants to push their code into the main branch/code. The process
        involves pushing their branch to their github account and creating a
        pull request for review and approval by the owner of the main branch to push the changes to the main branch.
